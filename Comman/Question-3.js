//: What is a prototype chain

/* Prototype chaining is used to build new types of object based on exiting ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language.

The prototype on object instance is available through Object.getPrototypeOf(object) or **proto** property whereas prototype on constructor function is available therough Object.prototype.*/
